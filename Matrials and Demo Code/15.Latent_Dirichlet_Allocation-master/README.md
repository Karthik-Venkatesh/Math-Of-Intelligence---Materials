# Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation
This is the Code for "Generative Models - The Math of Intelligence #8" By Siraj Raval on Youtube


# Coding Challenge - Due Date, Thursday August 10 at 12 PM PST

Write a script to perform Latent Dirichlet Allocation on a text dataset of your choice. Bonus points if it solves a real world problem. Sample datasets [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html?format=&task=&att=&area=&numAtt=&numIns=&type=text&sort=nameUp&view=table). Good luck!


## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/HyuBTMaKFmU) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of The Math of Intelligence course. I have 2 implementations of LDA here. The Jupyter notebook one uses helper libraries and the plain python one is from scratch. 

## Dependencies

* nltk
* numpy

Download missing dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Usage

Type `jupyter notebook` in terminal to see the code pop up in your browser. Install jupyter [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) if you haven't. For the python code, set the file manually in the code to your local dataset then run `python LDA.py`

## Credits

Credits for this code go to [moreene](https://github.com/morreene). I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
